# http-client-server-simple-go-app
This project aims to demonstrate the basics of building a simple HTTP client-server application using the Go programming language. The application consists of two main components:
HTTP Server: The server component listens for incoming HTTP requests and serves responses based on the requested URL path. It provides a home page when accessed and responds to other paths with appropriate content or status codes.

HTTP Client: The client component makes HTTP requests to the server and displays the response status. It's designed to interact with the server and demonstrate the client-server communication.

Key Features:

The server serves a basic home page when accessed at the root URL ("/").
The client makes an HTTP request to the server and prints the response status.
Demonstrates setting up a simple HTTP server and client in Go.
Illustrates how to handle requests and serve responses using the net/http package.
Provides a foundation for building more complex web applications or APIs in Go.
This project serves as a starting point for learning about HTTP communication in Go and can be extended with additional features or functionalities as needed.
